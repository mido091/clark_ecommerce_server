/**
 * @file variantStock.js
 * @description Utility functions for managing product variant stock levels.
 *
 * This module handles stock deduction and restoration atomically within DB transactions.
 * It supports two types of products:
 *  1. Simple products (no variants): Stock tracked directly on the `products` table
 *  2. Variant products (with colors/sizes): Stock tracked per variant in `product_variants`
 *     with the aggregate stock also synced back to `products.stock`
 *
 * Usage:
 *  - deductOrderItemStock  — Called when an order is placed (order creation)
 *  - restoreOrderItemStock — Called when an order is cancelled/rejected/returned
 *  - syncProductsStock     — Internal helper to keep products.stock in sync with variants
 *
 * IMPORTANT: All functions accept a `connection` argument (NOT the pool directly)
 * because they must run within the caller's active transaction to maintain atomicity.
 * Never call these functions with `db` (the pool) — always pass `connection`.
 */

/**
 * Synchronizes the aggregate stock on the `products` table from the sum of
 * all variant stocks in `product_variants`.
 *
 * Called automatically after deduct/restore operations on variant products.
 * This keeps `products.stock` consistent with the actual per-variant totals.
 *
 * Uses LEFT JOIN + COALESCE so that if a product has no variants,
 * its current `products.stock` value is preserved unchanged.
 *
 * @param {object}   connection - Active MySQL connection (within a transaction)
 * @param {number[]} productIds - Array of product IDs to sync

 * Deducts stock from the database when an order is placed.

 *  - For items without a variant_id (simple products): Deducts directly
 *    from `products.stock`
 *
 * Uses GREATEST(stock - qty, 0) to prevent negative stock values
 * (stock floor is 0 even if somehow oversold).
